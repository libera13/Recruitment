8. Phone Calls

Load the data from the "phone_data.csv" file. It contains 830 records that
describe phonecalls in a 5 month period. The files main columns are:

date - date and time of the record
duration - duration of the call (in seconds)
item - description of the record
month - month of settling ("YYYY-MM")
network - the name of the mobile network
network_type - type of the connection (mobile phone, voice mail etc.)

9. Single Game

You're in New York, 11PM. On 80th floor of Empire State Building in a luxury
apartment your beloved girlfriend is waiting for you. Unfortunately the
building is closed. A security guard, listening to your plead, will let you
inside the building, but meeting your girlfriend depends on a game you must
play with him.

Security guard:

We start at floor 0.
We have 100 moves.
Each move is a throw of a dice. Throwing 1 or 2 causes going down 1 floor below
(or staying at floor 0), throwing 3, 4 or 5 will let you go 1 floor up. If you
throw 6, you can throw again and go up as many floors as you get in the 2nd
throw.

If you are below 80th floor after 100 moves, you won't meet your girlfriend,
even if you were in the upper floor during the game.

Considering that your return flight is at 8 AM and in a bar next corner your
3 best friends are waiting for you, the perspective of spending your last
night with the security guard is not encouraging. You decide that you'll risk
that game only if the expected value of the game result is higher than 70.
You have a laptop with python 3 with you and at least two libraries: numpy and
pyplot. You decide to answer that question through smart simulation.

Paste code of a script simulating single game and screen of end chart
(with throws on X axis and floors on Y axis). Something like this:

10. 100 Game

Paste the code of a script simulating 100 game rounds and an image of a
chart showing all rounds (x axis - attempts, y axis - floors)

11. Histogram

Modify the script so that it simulates the game 5000 times and visualize
the results as a histogram (of the last floors that we achieved during
a game). Paste the code of the script as the solution along with a
picture of the histogram.
